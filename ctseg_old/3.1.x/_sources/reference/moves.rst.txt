Monte-Carlo updates (moves)
=============================

The Monte-Carlo space of configurations is explored using "updates" or "moves". In this page, we list the updates implemented in the code.
All updates can be turned on and off using the options of the ``solve()`` method of the solver (options corresponding to moves all start with ``move_`` by convention).

General updates
------------------------------------------------

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  triqs_ctseg/move_insert_segment
  triqs_ctseg/move_remove_segment
  triqs_ctseg/move_move_segment
  triqs_ctseg/move_swap_empty_lines

The last two moves enhance, but are in general not necessary for, ergodicity.

Updates for dynamical transverse spin interactions
-----------------------------------------------------

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  triqs_ctseg/move_insert_spin_segment
  triqs_ctseg/move_remove_spin_segment
  triqs_ctseg/move_swap_bosonic_lines
  triqs_ctseg/move_group_into_spin_segment
  triqs_ctseg/move_split_spin_segment

The last two moves enhance, but are in general not necessary for, ergodicity; they are an experimental feature and may still contain bugs.
