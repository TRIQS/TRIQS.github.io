About CTSEG
*************

The TRIQS/ctseg solver has been written by N. Kavokine and O. Parcollet, with contributions from H. Lu and N. Wentzell. The authors thank T. Ayral and M. Ferrero for sharing their unpublished implementation of CTSEG, which served as an inspiration and a benchmark for the present implementation. 

The hybridization expansion algorithm was originally developed in 2006 by Philipp Werner in the segment picture formulation [1] and later generalized to arbitrary local traces [2, 3]. Dynamical interactions was introduced later for density-density [4, 5] and spin-spin interactions [6,7], see Ref. [8] for a review.
