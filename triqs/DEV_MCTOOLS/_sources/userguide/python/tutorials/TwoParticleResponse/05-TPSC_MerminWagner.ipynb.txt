    "\n",
    "The Mermin-Wagner theorem [[Mermin and Wagner, Phys. Rev. Lett. 17, 1133 (1966)]](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.17.1133) states that a continuous-symmetry cannot be broken at finite temperature in two dimensions. So, finite temperature antiferromagnetism is impossible in two dimensions, contrary to the prediction of RPA. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a heuristic proof. Assume that the system has long range order and that the spins are collinear in the $z$-direction. Then the free energy density contains a term proportional to $(\\nabla S^z)^2/2$, where $S^z$ is the spin density operator in the $z$-direction. In Fourier space, this becomes $-q^2|S^z(\\mathbf{q})|^2/2$. In the long wavelength limit, where fluctuations are slow, we can use the classical equipartition theorem which gives \n",

    "The last equality follows from the fact $\\chi_{sp}''(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)$ is odd in frequency. This last result shows that the finite Matsubara frequencies should be regular and that the largest contribution is at the zeroth-Matsubara frequency. This allows us to give a rough idea of why the theorem is satisfied by focusing on the zero Matsubara frequency contribution. \n",

    "**Answer**: The zero-Matsubara frequency contribution to the local moment sum-rule is a logarithmically divergent integral when the correlation length is infinite. Since the right-hand side of the sum-rule is finite, the correlation length is forced to remain finite. If the momentum mesh is discrete and does not include $0$, the discrete numerical integral converges even for an infinite correlation length, so there is a finite transition temperature. See the remarks below for how to solve this problem. It amounts to basically doing a careful analysis of the asymptotic behavior, subtracting this asymptotic behavior in the numerical integral and adding the analytical expression for the asymptotic part.
