Multithreading
====================

TRIQS libraries, and in particular the arrays are NOT thread safe.

In some cases like arrays, it is a deliberate choice for performance.
In most cases, it is because no time was available to develop 
this aspect until now (and it was not useful for your projects...).

Help on this matter would be welcomed !
