If you encounter compile-time error messages such as::

        fatal error: mpi.h: No such file or directory
        fatal error: H5public.h: No such file or directory
        
make sure that the include directories of your openmpi and hdf5 installation are in the CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH :ref:`environment variable <environment_vars>`::

        export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/openmpi:/usr/include/hdf5/serial/:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
