    "The Lindhard susceptibility $\\chi_0$ is the exact susceptibility for the non-interacting case $U=0$, however for finite interactions the susceptibility of the system $\\chi$ is given by the Bethe-Salpeter equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\chi = \\chi_0 + \\chi_0 \\Gamma \\chi $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Gamma$ is the particle-hole irreducible vertex function, containing all diagrams with insertions of the interaction that can not be separated by cutting a pair of particle-hole single-particle propagators $G G$.\n",

    "note that the denominator of this equation can in general go to zero, whereby the susceptibility $\\chi_{RPA}$ diverges. Whence the RPA approximation can be used to compute instabilities of the system towards, e.g., anti-ferromagnetic symmetry breaking.\n",

    "As an example we compute $\\chi_{RPA}$ for the square lattice and the enhancement of the $\\mathbf{q} = (\\pi, \\pi)$ peak as a function of $U$.\n",

    "RPA predicts a phase transition to an antiferromagnetic state at *finite temperatures*. In two dimensions this is unphysical since the Mermin Wagner theorem tells us that the phase transition only occurs at zero temperature. \n",
