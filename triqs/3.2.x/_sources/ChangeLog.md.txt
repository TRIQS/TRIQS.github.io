### Porting Script

TRIQS 3.1.0 introduced a changes (summarized below) that require adjustments in TRIQS-based applications.
For convenient porting, we have updated our [porting script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TRIQS/triqs/unstable/porting_tools/port_to_triqs3)
that you can download and run in the top-level directory of your respository.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TRIQS/triqs/unstable/porting_tools/port_to_triqs3
chmod u+x port_to_triqs3
./port_to_triqs3
```

Make sure to review all changes before you commit them.
If you run into problems porting your application to this release, feel free to contact us by opening a [discussion](https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs/discussions) on github.

### Deprecate use of string indices for Green functions

In previous versions of TRIQS it was possible to use string indices when accessing
the matrix structure of a Green function in Python

```python
g = GfReFreq(indices = ['s','d'], window = (-2, 2), name = "s+d")
g['d','d'] << Omega - 1.0
g['d','s'] << V
g['s','d'] << V
g['s','s'] << Omega - 2.0
```

We are deprecating this feature due to lack of use and the implementational
complexity that this introduces in the library. Integer indices should be used instead

```python
g = GfReFreq(target_shape = (2, 2), window = (-2, 2), name = "s+d")
g[0, 0] << Omega - 1.0
g[0, 1] << V
g[1, 0] << V
g[1, 1] << Omega - 2.0
```

### Change in gf_struct objects

The aforementioned deprectation goes along with a change in the objects describing the structure
of block-diagonal green functions, in our documentation and tutorials often called `gf_struct`.

Python expressions of the kind

``gf_struct = [ ("up", [0, 1]), ("dn" : [0, 1]) ]``

should be replaced by

``gf_struct = [ ("up", 2), ("dn", 2) ]``

In other words, we ask that you only provide the linear matrix size of each block instead of
a list of indices. Correspondingly, the C++ type `triqs::gfs::gf_struct_t` has changed from

`std::vector<std::pair<std::string,std::vector<std::variant<int, std::string>>>>`

to

`std::vector<std::pair<std::string,long>>`

Note that we provide backward compatibility layers in most effected functions and in particular
in the interfaces of our applications TRIQS/cthyb, TRIQS/tprf and TRIQS/dft_tools.

### Green function meshes (C++)

The Green functions are now templated directly on the mesh types, making the `gf_mesh` template obsolete.
The meshes were further regrouped in the `triqs::mesh` namespace with some renamings:

* `gf_mesh<imfreq>` -> `mesh::imfreq`
* `gf_mesh<cyclic_lattice>` -> `mesh::cyclat`
* `gf_mesh<brillouin_zone>` -> `mesh::brzone`
* `gf_mesh<cartesian_product<..>>` -> `mesh::prod<..>`

We have kept aliases for backward compatibility.

This means for example that

```cpp
 auto m = gf_mesh<imfreq>{....};
 auto g = gf<imfreq>{m, {1,1}};
```

should now read

```cpp
 auto m = mesh::imfreq{....};
 auto g = gf<imfreq>{m, {1,1}}; // as before
```

The `triqs::lattice::brillouin_zone` was previously used both as the Brillouin Zone domain type
and as the tag for the associated mesh. If your code uses this class you should replace
those occurrences where the latter meaning applies with `mesh::brzone`. In short:

* triqs::lattice::brillouin_zone represents the Brillouin Zone domain
* triqs::mesh::brzone is the mesh on this domain

Before:
```cpp
  auto m = gf_mesh<brillouin_zone>{....};
  auto g = gf<cartesian_product<brillouin_zone,imfreq>> {{m, ...}, ....};
```

Now:
```cpp
  auto m = mesh::brzone{....};
  auto g = gf<prod<brzone,imfreq>>{{m, ...}, ....};
```

Backward compatibility help:

 * gf_mesh<T> is aliased to T, with deprecation.
 * [porting script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TRIQS/triqs/unstable/porting_tools/port_to_triqs3) mentioned above

### Move multi-array into TRIQS/nda library

We have moved the multi-array functionality out of the TRIQS library
and into the [TRIQS/nda](https://github.com/triqs/nda) repository.
TRIQS/nda is a standalone multi-array library that does not depend
on any components of triqs.

Note that most of the classes and functions previously available
in the `triqs::arrays` namespace are now defined in the `nda` namespace.
The relevant header files for nda are

* `nda/nda.hpp` for array, matrix, vector, their view classes, arithmetic ops and algorithms
* `nda/h5.hpp` for hdf5 read and write functions
* `nda/mpi.hpp` for mpi functionalities
* `nda/linalg.hpp` for linear algebra functions

### triqs::stat Rework

This release includes a rework of the statistics routines in triqs. Associated with this, we have renamed this part of
triqs from "statistics" to "stat" in C++ namespace, C++ headers, python module (where wrapped), and documentation. 

The main object of triqs::stat is the so-called `accumulator` class. This class takes in measurements during a Monte
Carlo simulation and serves a dual purpose: (a) to perform logarithmic binning which can be used to estimate the
auto-correlation time, (b) to perform linear binning to compress and the store data for further processing. The design
is flexible –- either log or lin binning can be turned off -- in order to be useful in different cases. (Note: In this
version, the estimation of the auto-correlation time is purposefully not fully automatic. Some user choice is required
to turn the binning data into an auto-correlation time estimate).

triqs::stat also includes function to calculate mean and standard errors (both single thread and mpi version) as well as
new jackknife routines (single thread and mpi versions).

Throughout, care has been taken to use numerically stable algorithms, especially when computing variances (mostly
two-pass or Welford).

The deprecated "statistics.hpp" including classes binned_series, ts_observer, jackknife, observable were removed.

The histogram class `histogram` is generally unchanged except header name / namespace changes.

Documentation can be found at https://triqs.github.io/triqs/latest/documentation/manual/triqs/stat/contents.html

### Bath discretization function

To fit a given hybridization function, either in imaginary frequency or time we provide now a bath discretization function (triqs.gf.tools.discretize_bath).
Given a input `delta_in` and a number of bath sites `Nb` the function will fit `Nb` bath energies and hoppings on the input Green function mesh.
The optimization is performed using scipy optimize minimizer BFGS (+basin hopping) or Nelder-Mead. More information can be found in the doc string.

We also added a function `make_delta` in `triqs.gf.tools` to construct a hybridization function on the imaginary axis for given hoppings and bath energies.

features of `discretize_bath`:
* allow to fit BlockGf objects, with blocks of arbitrary size
* allow to fit complex hybridization functions
* fit is directly performed on `iw` or `tau` depending on the input
* Nelder-Mead, or gradient based minimizer BFGS and basin hopping BFGS from scipy
* input guesses can be provided either as complete guess for the hoppings and / or energies, or as a single value for all hoppings
* if no guess for the hoppings is passed, the first guess is constructed from:
  `lim_{iw->inf} iw * Delta(iw)` or from `-Delta(0) - Delta(beta)` correspondingly.


### Jenkins Sanitizer Checks

We have extended our [Jenkins](https://jenkins.flatironinstitute.org/job/TRIQS/) CI setup to run the tests of TRIQS and compiled applications with
LLVM sanitizer checks enabled. In particular we make use of the [AdressSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html) and the
[UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html) to catch various kinds of memory errors
(e.g. out of bounds memory access) and undefined behavior during testing. This helps us to catch dangerous bugs early.

### New website theme

We changed the sphinx theme of the documentation to the [read the docs theme](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/).
The navigation of the website is done with a vertical sidebar on the left.
Additionally we fixed various broken references in the code manual, that sphinx could not build.
This theme is also deployed for all other triqs applications in version 3.1.0.
If you should find any broken websites please open an [issue](https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs/issues).

### TightBinding and TBLattice improvements

We have improved the user interface for the tight-binding objects both in C++ and Python.
This effects the C++ class `triqs::lattice::tight_binding` as well as the Python classes
`triqs.lattice.TightBinding` and `triqs.lattice.TBLattice`. All classes now provide
member functions `fourier(k)` and `dispersion(k)` to calculate `h(k)` and its energy spectrum
for single k-points, arrays of k-points and even on a given k-point mesh.
We also deprecate the function `hopping`, which is now equivalent to `fourier` due to its confusing name.

We have further added additional Python utility functions `triqs.lattice.utils`
* `TB_from_wannier90`: Create TBLattice object from a wannier90 output file
* `TB_from_pythTB`: Create TBLattice object from [pythtb](https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/).tb_model
* `k_space_path`: Generate a Brillouin Zone path and relevant plotting information

### Require C++20 capable compiler

## Version 3.0.1

TRIQS Version 3.0.1 is a patch release that fixes a number of
issues. In particular a crucial issue in relation to the atom_diag
class was resolved.

We provide a more detailed description of the changes and fixes below.

### Issue 819 - Atom Diag

For certain Hamiltonians and orderings of the fundamental_operator_set
the atom_diag class would yield incorrect eigenenergies. Please refer to
issue [#819](https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs/issues/819) for more details.

We provide a simple mechanism to detect if a given model was affected by the issue.
By setting the runtime environment variable `CHECK_ISSUE819` to an arbitrary value with e.g. `export CHECK_ISSUE819=1`
before starting the calculation, TRIQS will now throw an exception if the model was affected before.

This bug was fixed in pull request [#820](https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs/pull/820).

### General
* Add block_matrix to cpp2py converter table
* Add missing includes in utility/variant_extensions.hpp

* Correction issue in TRIQSConfig.cmake.in
* Treat cmake options before adding build dirs, fail if Build_Documentation AND NOT PythonSupport
* Link triqs_py against proper namespaced cpp2py target

## Version 3.0.0

TRIQS Version 3.0.0 is a major release that
* introduces compatibility with Python 3 (Python 2 no longer supported)
* separates out the [h5](https://github.com/triqs/h5), [mpi](https://github.com/triqs/mpi) and [itertools](https://github.com/triqs/itertools) functionality of the TRIQS library
* fixes several library issues

A guide with instructions on how to port your application can be found [here](https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs/blob/unstable/doc/porting_to_triqs3.md).
We provide a detailed list of the changes below.

We thank all the people who have contributed to this release: Alexander Hampel, Olivier Parcollet, Malte Schueler, Hiroshi Shinaoka, Dylan Simon, Nils Wentzell, Manuel Zingl, Rok Žitko

### Renamings

The separation of various TRIQS library functionalities into their
own repositories made it necessary to rename various Python modules
as well C++ header files. In addition, we have decided to
rename the top-level Python module of TRIQS from 'pytriqs' to 'triqs'.
These renamings can be automated using the [porting script](https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs/blob/unstable/porting_tools/port_to_triqs3)
that we provide. Please refer to our [porting guide](https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs/blob/unstable/doc/porting_to_triqs3.md) for more
detailed instructions.

### Dependency Management

We are managing the interdependencies of the various
library components [cpp2py](https://github.com/triqs/cpp2py), [h5](https://github.com/triqs/h5), [mpi](https://github.com/triqs/mpi) and [itertools](https://github.com/triqs/h5) using cmake.
Per default cmake will pull those dependencies from their corresponding
GitHub repositories, build them, and install these components together
with TRIQS, unless they are found in your system.
This behavior can be altered using the additional cmake options

* `-DBuild_Deps="Always"` - Always build dependencies, do not try to find them
* `-DBuild_Deps="Never"` - Never build dependencies, but find them instead

during the configuration step.

### h5py dependency

The dependency on h5py has been a source of of problems in setting up
the TRIQS library for many users. We are glad to report that TRIQS 3.0
is no longer dependent on h5py, and instead provides the necessary
Python bindings directly in the [h5](https://github.com/triqs/h5) repository,
which per default is built and installed together with TRIQS.

### Removal of deprecated API

Some parts of the TRIQS library API that have been deprecated in earlier releases
were removed. This includes,
```
InverseFourier, set_from_inverse_fourier, make_gf_from_inverse_fourier, triqs.applications.XXX, g.N1, g.N2, g.beta, g.statistic, g.indicesL, g.indicesR
```
for the Python API and
```
block_gf.domain(), block_gf.mesh(), get_gf_data_shape, get_target_shape
```
in C++.
Note that the [porting script](https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs/blob/unstable/porting_tools/port_to_triqs3) will replace some of these with the proper syntax.

## Version 2.2.0

TRIQS Version 2.2.0 introduces substantial performance
improvements by reworking the array memory allocation and
by further changing the behavior of view types of arrays and
Green functions. The Release also introduces structural
changes to the mpi and itertools components to make them
usable as standalone components.
Beyond that, this release fixes several library issues
and improves the documentation. We provide a more detailed
description of the changes below.

### Make range and itertools functionality standalone

We have pulled the functionality for integer ranges
and the range-adapting functionality (product, enumerate, ...)
out of the TRIQS namespaces and made the headers standalone.
This functionality now lives in the itertools namespace
and resides in the top-level itertools folder.
Tests can be found in test/itertools.


### Make mpi functionality standalone and change namespace

We have pulled the generic mpi functionality
(communicator, gather(basic_type), reduce(basic_type), ...)
out of the triqs::mpi namespace and made the headers standalone.
This functionality now lives in the mpi namespace and resides
in the top-level mpi folder. Tests can be found in test/mpi.
In particular, includes of the header files triqs/mpi/base.hpp and
triqs/mpi/vector.hpp should now be replaced with with includes to
the according file in the mpi directory.


### Non-owning views (C++)

We have changed the behavior of view-types within TRIQS.
Prior to TRIQS 2.2 any view (gf_view, array_view, ...) would make sure that
the data of the underlying object (gf, array, ...) is kept alive
until all views and the object itself are destroyed. This was achieved
through a so-called reference-counting mechanism that lead to
substantial performance penalties in some cases. In TRIQS 2.2 view-types
no longer keep the underlying memory alive and are thus only valid as long as
the base-object is valid.
Let us illustrate this with two examples:

Example 1: Returning view-types

```c++
array_view<int, 1> f() { return array<int, 1>{1, 2, 3}; }
```

Here, the `array<int, 1>` is immediately destroyed at the end of the function body.
The view-type that we return is thus immediately invalid. We should instead return
an `array<int, 1>`.

```c++
array<int, 1> f() { return array<int, 1>{1, 2, 3}; }
```

Example 2: Constructing a view from a temporary

```c++
array_view<int, 1> av{ zeros<int>(10) };
```

Here we construct an `array_view<int 1>` from a temporary of type `array<int, 1>`.
The temporary will be destroyed immediately after the construction,
invalidating the view. We should instead be creating an `array<int, 1>`

```c++
array<int, 1> arr{ zeros(10) };
```

Note that no unnecessary copies will be made in the code above.

Our analysis has shown that in practice this change in behavior rarely affects existing applications.
You can however automatically detect any problems related to this change by using the dynamic analyzer checks described
in the following.

### Dynamic Analyzer Checks (ASAN, UBSAN)

The clang and gcc compiler provide so-called dynamic analyzer checks that allow us to
detect various memory access errors and occurances of undefined behavior.
We have simplified the process of running these checks for TRIQS and any application based
on the app4triqs skeleton by adding additional options to the cmake configuration.
In order to run these checks you will need to configure TRIQS and your application
with -DASAN=ON and/or -DUBSAN=ON.

### No longer install googletest

The build-system of the TRIQS library will no longer install the googletest project as this can
lead to conflicts with system-provided packages. Applications should instead compile and link against
their own version of googletest.
This is done for example in the [app4triqs](https://github.com/TRIQS/app4triqs) application skeleton.

### app4triqs

Starting with TRIQS Version 2.2.0 we will issue compatible releases of the [app4triqs](https://github.com/TRIQS/app4triqs) application skeleton.
These will serve as a basis to the corresponding compatible releases of many of our official applications.
Making adjustments to the project structure directly within [app4triqs](https://github.com/TRIQS/app4triqs)
allows us to easily propagate these changes to all compatible applications.

## Version 2.1.0

TRIQS Version 2.1.0 is a bugfix release.
It resolves a variety of issues. In particular it addresses
a series of stability issues with the new treatment of
the high-frequency tails of the Green Function as it was
introduced in Version 2.0.0.

When upgrading to TRIQS 2.1.0 be sure to account for the updated
install instructions. The cpp2py tool will now be automatically
installed together with TRIQS and should no longer be installed
seperately. The corresponding cpp2py deb package should thus
also be removed.

## Version 1.5


To port an application's cmakelists:

* The best is to look at a complete example, ctint tutorial or cthyb.
* Import TRIQS AND Cpp2Py which are 2 separate packages now.
* We now use modern cmake techniques, i.e. imported targets
* Simply link your target to triqs (imported target).

  Remove ``TRIQS_CXX_DEFINITIONS`` ``TRIQS_INCLUDE_ALL`` and co.
* Obsolete : TRIQSTest are deprecated. Cf cthyb and ctint tutorial for examples.
* build_pytriqs is also removed. Cf test/python in cthyb to set up the environment variable properly

* New Python interface for Gf.

EXPLAIN


### API changes

* Remove the gf.local module, simply use gf

  ``from pytriqs.gf.local import ... --> from pytriqs.gf import ...``

* ``g.indices -> g.indices[0]``

* Change gf_struct_t in fundamental_operator_set.hpp from

  ``std::map<std::string,std::vector<std::variant<int, std::string>>>``

  to

  ``std::vector<std::pair<std::string,std::vector<std::variant<int, std::string>>>>``

  to properly maintain the order of blocks.

* In any Python script, replace e.g.

  ``gf_struct = { "up" : [0, 1], "dn" : [0, 1] }``
  by

  ``gf_struct = [ ["up", [0, 1]], ["dn" : [0, 1]] ]``

Deprecation


## Version 1.4

### Documentation

* Replace Doxygen by the local simpler tool c++2doc.

### Installation


* boost mpi is no longer detected by triqs.
  You can either add 2 lines to
  detect it in CMake, or port your apps to triqs::mpi.
  To port an apps using mpi :

  * detect boost mpi lib, and link to it, using e.g. in CMakeLists :

    find_package(Boost ${BOOST_VERSION} REQUIRED COMPONENTS mpi serialization system)
    link_libraries(${Boost_LIBRARIES})

  * include "boost/mpi.hpp" if needed.

* The library is installed in C++14 mode.

* New install/build conventions for apps.
  Here are the changes to be made:

  * in _desc.py

  1) ``m = module(full_name = 'module_name', app_name='application_a')``
     (instead of ``full_name="pytriqs.applications.application_a.module_name"``)
  2) ``m.use_module("gf", "triqs")``
     (instead of ``m.use_module("gf")``)
  3) ``m.add_include(... with path relative to c++ dir (not relative to current dir))``
     (e.g. ``add_include(solver_core.hpp)`` instead of ``add_include("../c++/solver_core.hpp")``)

  * in CMakeLists.txt

  4) add line include_directories(c++)

  * in python/CMakeLists.txt

  5) change python_destination: remove pytriqs.applications...
  6) change triqs_python_extension: change to triqs_python_extension_and_install, and remove second argument
  7) change install DESTINATION : replace variable TRIQS_PYTHON_LIB_DEST with PYTHON_LIB_DEST_ROOT

  * in your python scripts:

  8) replace everywhere ``pytriqs.applications.*`` with ``*``

  A more detailed documentation can be found here: https://triqs.github.io/triqs/1.x/tutorials/using_the_lib/application_structure.html


### Many-body operators


* They are now polymorphic, they can handle complex and real case.
  many_body_operator is not a template any more.
  many_body_operator_generic<ScalarType> is the general case.

* The are in triqs::operators namespace (moved from utility).

### Green's functions

* Added support for complex G(tau). By default G(tau) is complex.

* Accordingly G(iw) is defined by default on the full (positive and negative) frequency axis.
  Plotting is affected.

* [API break] As a consequence G.data is twice as big. Now G.data[0] refers to the
  smallest negative frequency so older codes using direct data access will break.
  The n^th frequency can be retrieved with G(n) which is the recommended usage as it is
  independent from the storage details.

* Fourier transforms have been updated.

* When writing to HDF5:

  * If the imaginary part of G(tau) is zero, then G(tau) is written as a real array (to gain space)
    otherwise it is written as a complex array
  * If the negative and positive frequencies of G(iw) are all equivalent through G(-iw) = G(iw)*
    then only the positive frequencies are saved (to gain space). Otherwise the full axis is
    written
  * Note that the behavior described above is only followed when writing to the HDF5 file. When
    a G(tau) or a G(iw) is read from the HDF5, it will always be turned into a complex G(tau)
    or a G(iw) on the full frequency axis.


### Tests

* All c++ tests have been ported to Google test.

* The c++ test tools have been reorganized into ``triqs/test_tools``. The google test sources are there
  as well as two headers ``gfs.hpp`` and ``arrays.hpp`` with macros to easily compare arrays
  and Green's functions within a google test code.

* The test cmake files have been simplified. There are just two macros to run a test:

  * ``add_cpp_test(testname)`` that adds a c++ test.
  * ``add_python_test(testname)`` that adds a python test.
  * From an external project these macros are called ``triqs_add_cpp_test`` and
    ``triqs_add_python_test``.

* For both tests, if there is a file ``testname.ref`` then the output of the test,
  written in a file ``testname.out`` will be compared to ``testname.ref`` and the test
  will fail if they are different.

* It is now up to the user to check a result against a reference archive. As a convention,
  the reference archives end with .ref.h5 and the test generates a file .out.h5. The
  program h5diff is no longer used by the library (h5diff had several limitations). The
  python tests have been changed accordingly.

* The module ``pytriqs.utility.comparison_tests`` has functions that make it easy to
  compare arrays and green's functions in a python script.

* The module ``pytriqs.utility.h5diff`` allows to compare two archives.




## Version 1.3

### Installation

* TRIQS depends on a number of third-party Sphinx extensions to build its documentation.
  These extensions are now installed under `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/triqs/sphinxext`, in order to let TRIQS-based application to reuse the extensions and to inherit the visual style of the docs.
* Preinstalled Sphinx extension sphinxcontrib-doxylink is not needed anymore to build the documentation.

### Green functions

* New Python method `DOS.copy()`.
* New convenience functions in module `pytriqs.gf.local.tools`,

  * `inverse()`: compute the inverse of a Green's function;
  * `delta()`: compute Delta_iw from G0_iw;
  * `dyson()`: solve Dyson's equation for given two of G0_iw, G_iw and Sigma_iw to yield the third;
  * `tail_fit()`: fit the tails of Sigma_iw and optionally G_iw;
  * `read_gf_from_txt()`/`write_gf_to_txt()`: read/write a GfReFreq from/to text files.

### Many-body operators

* HDF5 support.
* Various utilities related to the many-body operators are organized in a separate sub-package `pytriqs.operators.util`. It includes the following modules,

  * `hamiltonian`: commonly-used Hamiltonians, Slater, Kanamori, density-density;
  * `U_matrix` (moved from dft_tools): construction of interaction matrices;
  * `observables`: operators of commonly used observables (S_z, S^2, L_z, L^2, L*S and so on);
  * `op_struct`: auxiliary functions to work with spin and orbital indices.

### Monte-Carlo tools

* Function `mc_generic::start()` returns different exit codes depending on the way it has been stopped, by receiving a signal or by `stop_callback()`.

### Determinant manipulation

* New functions `insert2()`, `remove2()`, `change_row()` and `change_col()`, which are combinations of `try_*` and `complete_operation()`.
* New functions `insert2_at_end()`, `remove_at_end()` and `remove2_at_end()`.
* Optimized version of `change_one_row_and_one_col()` and other minor optimizations.

### HDF5

* Support for `unsigned long long`.
* The lists and tuples in Python are now written by hdf_archive with keys as "0", "1", "2", "3", instead of "00000000", "00000001", "0000002", "0000003", ...
  This is necessary for C++ compatibility, where `std::vector<T>` is written in HDF5 as a subgroup with object named by their number, for generic T (i.e. not `int`, `double`, `std::string`).
  This change is backward compatible: old archive can be read by new code, but would break h5diff.

### c++2py

* Support for rich comparison methods.
* Make sure to include array converter in gf converter
* New C++ attribute `ignore_in_python` that prevents a class method from wrapping in Python.
* One can use two special line prefixes, `type:` and `default:` when documenting a member of the parameter class. They allow to override the corresponding fields in the generated table.
* Converters for `unsigned int`, `unsigned long` and `unsigned long long`.
* Converter for `std::tuple` (from any Python sequence/to `tuple()`).
* `std::pair` is now converted to `tuple()`.

### Tests

* The Google Test framework (https://github.com/google/googletest) has been adopted by the project. Some of C++ test have been ported to it.
* New header file `test_tools.hpp` with convenience functions and additional GTest macros for C++ testing.

### Miscellaneous

* Added a reference to a Computer Physics Communications paper about TRIQS.
* Numerous updates to the documentation.


## Version 1.2

### C++

* New wrapping of boost random generators. No effect on API.
* HDF5 cleaned, now using only C library (not C++) for simpler installation.

### Python

* New wrapper tool to glue C++ and Python. Cython is gone.

### Green Functions

* `transpose()` method now returns a NEW green function, like `conjugate()`, etc...
* Suppress the possibility to save/load in HDF5 for a tail alone (must be part of a GF).



### Version 1.1

* New constructors for the gf [api change]
* Fix for gf expression templates
* The gf tails now have fixed size to avoid mpi problems
* Fixes in gf expression templates
* New python random generator interface
* Fixes for issues #11, #18, #25


### Version 1.0

There have been changes from versions 0.x to 1.0.0 that will most likely have
consequences for your scripts and archives.

### Python classes

The number of python classes in the old 0.x releases was increasing with no
clear naming convention. In TRIQS 1.0 we have unified the naming of the classes
following the `PEP naming conventions
<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions>`_:

* Package and module names: lowercase with underscores
* Class names: CapWords
* Function names: lowercase with underscores
* Function and method arguments: lowercase with underscores

### Archives

We provide an update script ``porting_tools/update_archive.py`` which should
help you upgrade your archive. The usage is very simple::

  $ python update_archive.py old_archive new_archive

where ``old_archive`` is your old archive to be upgraded and ``new_archive`` is
the name of the new archive. If you encounter problems please post an
issue with a copy of your archive.
