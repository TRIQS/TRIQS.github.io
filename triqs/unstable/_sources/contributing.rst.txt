Contributing
============

.. note::
   Do not open an issue on github if you have questions regarding the usage of the code
   which are specific to your problem. Consolidate the :ref:`documentation` and the
   :ref:`userguide` first. Should this not answer your questions, you can get in contact with
   other users and developers via our `Google group <https://triqs.github.io/announcements>`_.
