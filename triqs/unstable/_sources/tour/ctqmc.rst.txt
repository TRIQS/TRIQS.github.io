 
Solving a quantum impurity model with CTQMC 
-------------------------------------------

.. note::
 
   Requires TRIQS and the :doc:`application cthyb <../../applications>`

Free electrons are nice, but the `I` in TRIQS stands for `interacting`, so 
let us solve a simple one-band Anderson impurity model

.. math::

  \mathcal{H}_\mathrm{loc} = U n_\uparrow n_\downarrow,

where the non-interacting Green's function is:

.. math::

  G^{-1}_{0,\sigma} (i \omega_n) = i \omega_n - \epsilon_f - V^2 \Gamma_\sigma(i \omega_n).

In this example, an impurity with the non-interacting level position at energy
:math:`\epsilon_f` and on-site Coulomb repulsion :math:`U` is embedded into an
electronic bath. The electronic bath has a flat density of states over the
interval :math:`[-1,1]` and hybridizes  with the impurity with the amplitude
:math:`V`.

We solve this model using the hybridization expansion Continuous Time Quantum
Monte Carlo method (CT-HYB) proposed by `P. Werner et al
<http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.076405>`_.

To this end we first initialize the ``Solver`` class of the TRIQS CT-HYB
implementaion ``pytriqs.applications.impurity_solvers.cthyb``.
Then, after having constructed the non-interacting Green's function
:math:`G^{-1}_{0,\sigma}`, we launch the impurity solver calculations by
calling the ``Solve`` method.  Finally, the resulting interacting Green's
function as well as the average impurity occupancy is stored in the 
:ref:`HDF5 format<hdf5_base>`.

.. runblock:: python

   from pytriqs.gf import *
   from pytriqs.operators import *
   from pytriqs.applications.impurity_solvers.cthyb import Solver
   
   # Parameters
   D, t, U = 1.0, 0.2, 4.0
   e_f, beta = -U/2.0, 50.0
   
   # Construct the impurity solver with the inverse temperature
   # and the structure of the Green's functions
   S = Solver(beta = beta, gf_struct = [('up',[0]), ('down',[0])]
   
   # Initialize the non-interacting Green's function S.G0_iw
   for spin, g0 in S.G0_iw:
       g0 << inverse( iOmega_n - e_f - t**2 * Flat(D) ) 
   
   # Set the solver parameters.
   params = {}
   params['n_cycles'] = 1000000                # Number of QMC cycles
   params['length_cycle'] = 200                # Length of one cycle 
   params['n_warmup_cycles'] = 10000           # Warmup cycles
   params['measure_g_l'] = True                # Measure G in legendre
   
   # Run the solver. The result will be stored in S.G_tau.
   S.solve(h_int = U * n('up',0) * n('down',0), \**params)
   
   # Save the results in an hdf5 file (only on the master node).
   from pytriqs.archive import HDFArchive
   import pytriqs.utility.mpi as mpi
   
   if mpi.is_master_node():
     Results = HDFArchive("solution.h5",'w')
     Results["G_tau"] = S.G_tau
     Results["G_l"] = S.G_l


The result can be then read from the ``HDF5`` file and plotted using the ``oplot`` function:

.. literalinclude::  aim_plot.py

.. image:: aim_plot.png
   :width: 700
   :align: center

We go through this example in more detail in the documentation of the cthyb application. 
 
FIXME: 
    * add link
    * add comment that the qns are automatically determined
    * recheck link to the HDF5 tutorial/reference
