c++2py: a C++/Python interfacing tool 
=========================================

This TRIQS tool aims at generating the necessary wrapping code between C++ and Python.
Wrapping C++ functions and classes in Python is a non trivial problem because the two languages are quite different
(e.g. C++ uses typically value semantics, while Python uses only counted references, the C++ equivalent of std::shared_ptr).

This tool has the following main features:

 * it is entirely automatic in most cases, i.e. except for some advanced features that require additionnal inputs. 
 * it is quite flexible.
 * it can be used with a magic cell command in the Python notebook.
