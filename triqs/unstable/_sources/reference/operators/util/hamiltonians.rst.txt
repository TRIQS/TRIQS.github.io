Hamiltonians
============

.. highlight:: python

A set of Python functions to construct standard Hamiltonians is provided in the module ``pytriqs.operators.util.hamiltonians``.
Namely, three standard local interaction Hamiltonians are implemented: Slater, (Hubbard-)Kanamori and density-density Hamiltonians.
The Hamiltonians can be written for any set of spin and orbital names. Note that there is no actual notion of spin, the spin names
simply identify a division of the GF structure into non-hybridizing blocks.
