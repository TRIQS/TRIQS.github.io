User guide
==========

Welcome to the TRIQS project!

This guide aims at presenting you the main classes of TRIQS and its applications through ready-to-use examples. These small demo codes
should help you understand the logic behind the general design and organization of the library.

.. note::

     We strongly recommend first-time users to go through the extensive set of Jupyter Notebook tutorials provided on `GitHub <https://github.com/TRIQS/tutorials>`_.
     You can run the notebooks either in an interactive `Binder Session <https://triqs.github.io/notebook>`_ on the web
     or run them locally after setting up TRIQS on your computer.

.. warning::

     This pages does not aim to replace the full reference of the code available :ref:`here <documentation>`.


Why use TRIQS?
--------------

TRIQS is a powerful library that allows you to easily write code to study strongly correlated problems.
It is designed as a toolkit containing all the essential ingredients to tackle condensed matter physics.
Before presenting you the tools available both in C++ and Python, we want you to have a look at a small script 
where a full Dynamical Mean-Field Theory calculation using the Continuous-Time Hybridization Expansion (CT-HYB) solver 
is realized in... one page!
