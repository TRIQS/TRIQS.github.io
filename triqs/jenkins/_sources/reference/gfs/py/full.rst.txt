**BlockGf**: The complete Green's function
=============================================

As mentioned in the introduction, due to the symmetry, a local Green's function usually
has a block structure.
We refer to this object as the `full` or `complete` Green's function, in contrast to
the blocks it is made of.

Most properties of this object can be remembered by the simple sentence:

`A full Green's function is an ordered dictionary {name -> block}, or equivalently a list of tuples (name, block).`

The blocks can be any of the matrix-valued Green's functions described :ref:`above<blockgreen>`.
The role of this object is to gather them, and simplify the code writing
by factorizing some simple operations.

A little example
--------------------

To start with an example, imagine that the problem
that we consider could involve 5 d-bands of a solid that, for symmetry reasons,
are separated into 2 eg and 3 t2g bands. We therefore first construct the 2
corresponding block Green's functions (in Matsubara frequencies for example)
and group these blocks into a full Green's function `G` with::

  from pytriqs.gf import *
  g1 = GfImFreq(indices = ['eg1','eg2'], beta = 50, n_points = 1000, name = "egBlock")
  g2 = GfImFreq(indices = ['t2g1','t2g2','t2g3'], beta = 50, n_points = 1000, name = "t2gBlock")
  G = BlockGf(name_list = ('eg','t2g'), block_list = (g1,g2), make_copies = False)

where:

* `name_list` is the ordered list of the names of the blocks. 
* `block_list` is the corresponding list of block Green's function. 
* `make_copies` lets you specify if the blocks of the full Green's function are **copies** of the blocks given in
  `block_list` or if they are **views** of these blocks, see :ref:`below<fullgreencopypolicy>`

These names will be used when we try to access a particular block, for example ::

  >>> G
 Green Function G composed of 2 blocks:
  gf_view
  gf_view

  >>> G['eg']
  gf_view


Reference 
----------------

.. autoclass:: pytriqs.gf.BlockGf
  :members: copy, copy_from


Operations
---------------

The full Green's functions support various simple operations, that are simply done block by block.

.. note::
   All these operations compute the array of data, but also, if present in the object, the high frequency expansion tail automatically.

* compound operators, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `\=`: RHS can be a Green's function of the same type or an expression

* arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, e.g. ::

   G = G1 + 2*G2

* inversion, e.g. ::

   inv = inverse(g)
   g2 = inverse(inverse(g) - sigma) # this is a Dyson equation

Block access
----------------

Blocks can be accessed like in a `dict` :

These names will be used when we try to access a particular block, for example ::

  G['eg']

The generic way to access a Green's function element :math:`G^a_{i j}` is therefore ::

  G[a][i,j]

Iterator
--------------------

One can iterate on the blocks ::

    for name, g in G: 
      do_something()

In the example above ::

  >>> for name, g in G:
  ...  print name, g

  eg gf_view
  t2g gf_view

As a result ::

    BlockGf(name_block_generator = G, make_copies = False)

generates a new Green's function `G`, viewing the same blocks.
More interestingly ::

    BlockGf(name_block_generator = [(name,g) for (name,g) in G if Test(name), make_copies = False)]

makes a partial view of some of the blocks selected by the `Test` condition.

.. warning::
   The order in which the blocks appear is guaranteed to be the same as in the constructor.
   This is why the Green's function is similar to an **ordered** dictionary, not a simple dict.

.. _fullgreencopypolicy:

View or copies?
---------------------

The Green's function is to be thought like a dict, hence accessing the 
block returns references. When constructing the Green's function BlockGf, 
the parameter `make_copies` determines if a copy of the blocks must be made 
before putting them in the Green's function.

.. note::
   This is the standard behaviour in python for a list or a dict.

Example: 

* If you define a Green's function with::

   G = BlockGf(name_list = ('eg','t2g'), block_list = (g1,g2), make_copies = False)

  .. note:: 
 
    `make_copies` is optional; its default value is False. We keep it here for clarity.

  The ``make_copies = False`` implies that the blocks of ``G`` are *references* ``g1`` and ``g2``.
  So, if you modify ``g1``, say by putting it to zero with ``g1.zero()``, then the
  first block of G will also be put to zero. Similarly, imagine you define two
  Green's functions like this::

   G1 = BlockGf(name_list = ('eg','t2g'), block_list = (g1,g2), make_copies = False)
   G2 = BlockGf(name_list = ('eg','t2g'), block_list = (g1,g2), make_copies = False)

  Then, G1 and G2 are exactly the same object, because they both have blocks
  which are views of ``g1`` and ``g2``. 

* Instead, if you write::

   G = BlockGf(name_list = ('eg','t2g'), block_list = (g1,g2), make_copies = True)

  The ``make_copies = True`` ensures that the blocks of ``G`` are new copies of ``g1``
  and ``g2``. If you then modify ``g1`` it will not have any effect on G.
  Clearly if you define::

   G1 = BlockGf(name_list = ('eg','t2g'), block_list = (g1,g2), make_copies = True)
   G2 = BlockGf(name_list = ('eg','t2g'), block_list = (g1,g2), make_copies = True)

  Here ``G1`` and ``G2`` are different objects, both having made copies
  of ``g1`` and ``g2`` for their blocks.

  An equivalent definition would be ::

    G1 = BlockGf(name_list = ('eg','t2g'), block_list = (g1.copy(),g2.copy()))
    G2 = BlockGf(name_list = ('eg','t2g'), block_list = (g1.copy(),g2.copy()))

shelve / pickle 
---------------------

Green's functions are `picklable`, i.e. they support the standard python serialization techniques.

* It can be used with the `shelve <http://docs.python.org/library/shelve.html>`_ and `pickle <http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html>`_  module::
  
     import shelve
     s = shelve.open('myfile','w')
     s['G'] = G  # G is stored in the file.

* It can be sent/broadcasted/reduced over mpi ::

     from pytriqs.utility import mpi
     mpi.send(G, destination)

.. warning::

   Shelve is not a portable format, it may change from python version to another (and it does).
   For portability, we recommend using the HDF5 interface for storing data on disks.


HDF5
