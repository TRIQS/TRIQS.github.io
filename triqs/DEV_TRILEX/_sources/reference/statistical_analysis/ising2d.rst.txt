Full example: Monte-Carlo simulation of the 2D Ising model
===========================================================

The following example is the full implementation of a Monte-Carlo sampling of the magnetization of a 2D Ising model with statistical analysis.

For more information about the workings of the Monte-Carlo worker, we refer the reader to the :doc:`reference <../monte_carlo/contents>`.
