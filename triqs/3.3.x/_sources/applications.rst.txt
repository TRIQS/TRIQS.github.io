**Applications based on TRIQS**
###############################

The TRIQS library provides all the necessary building blocks for the
development of applications for the study of interacting quantum systems.
These applications can be grouped into one of the following categories

* **Official applications**

  These applications have readily been developed and are maintained by the TRIQS
  collaboration.

* **External applications**

  These applications were developed and are maintained externally but are still fundamentally
  relying on TRIQS library features.

* **Interfaces to external codes**

  These applications are thin wrappers around TRIQS independent codes that are developed and
  maintained externally. The maintenance of the interface layer is commonly shared between the
  TRIQS collaboration and the external developers.

If you would like to have your application listed please contact us directly.

**Impurity Solvers**
====================

**Hybridization-expansion solver**
----------------------------------

The hybridization-expansion solver is an official TRIQS application that allows
to solve the generic problem of a quantum impurity embedded in a conduction bath.
It is based on a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that stochastically samples the
diagrams of a hybridization expansion of the partition function.

For publications based on results produced with this application please cite `Comput. Phys. Comm. 200, 274 (2016) <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001046551500404X>`_

**Hubbard I solver**
-------------------------------

This solver gives the Hubbard I solution of a quantum impurity problem,
i.e. it solves the atomic limit. This simple approximation allows for
very quick answers even for large multiband systems.

*Homepage:* `<https://triqs.github.io/hubbardI/>`_

**Hartree Fock solver**
-------------------------------

This solver calculates the self-consistent Hartree or Hartree Fock approximation for
a given quantum impurity or lattice problem. It uses gradient descent to solve the
self-consistency at fixed density or chemical potential. The solver is limited to
static and local interactions.
