## Version 4.0.0

dftkit version 4.0.0 is the first release of the toolkit and is compatible with
TRIQS version 4.0.0. dftkit bundles the DFT-code interfaces that turn the output
of various DFT codes into the TRIQS-compatible HDF5 format consumed by
[DFTTools](https://triqs.github.io/dft_tools), providing a modern, modular
successor to the converters historically shipped with DFTTools. For each
supported code it provides a converter and, where available, a driver for
charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT calculations.

Find below an itemized list of changes in this release.

### General
* Port the DFT converters (Elk, Wien2k, Wannier90, generic H(k), VASP/PLOVasp) from the `triqs_dft_tools` repository
* Port the `dmftproj` Fortran component used by the Wien2k interface from `triqs_dft_tools`

### Drivers
* Add drivers that wrap the DFT executable for charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT runs, covering Quantum Espresso, Wien2k, Abinit and VASP

### VASP
* Add a VASP driver for charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT calculations
* Warn on misplaced or unknown tags in the PLOVASP configuration

### Wannier90
* Add ABINIT support to `Wannier90Converter` for charge self-consistent calculations
* Read VASP `ICHARG=5` miscellaneous input from `vaspout.h5`

### Fix
* Fix a bug in the `deltaN` write for the Quantum Espresso and Abinit interfaces

### doc
* Document the converter + driver architecture and the per-code interface table
* Rework the landing page and documentation index

### build
* Compatible with TRIQS 4.0.0 and the latest app4triqs/4.0.x skeleton
