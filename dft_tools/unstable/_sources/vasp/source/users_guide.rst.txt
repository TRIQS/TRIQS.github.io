PLOVasp is a set of tools for performing DFT+DMFT calculations within
the fromalism of projected localized orbitals (PLO) using
VASP in combination with the TRIQS package.
It relies on projectors implemented in VASP >= 5.4.1 and generated with
the option LOCPROJ in INCAR. The main goal of PLOVasp is to use these raw 
projectors generated by VASP to produce PLOs and to convert them to the standard
format of DFTTools, which allows a user to use the same DMFT scripts
as for Wien2TRIQS interface, with only the converter class being replaced.

Currently PLOVasp supports only one-shot DFT+DMFT calculations, with
the full charge self-consistency being in the process of implementation.

PLOVasp package consists of two main parts:
  * A set of tools for processing VASP-generated projectors
  * A converter class VaspConverter that prepares an HDF5 file for DFTTools
 
A typical one-shot DFT+DMFT calculation is generally performed as follows:
  * Run VASP with LOCPROJ option to generate raw projectors 
  * Write an input file and run PLOVasp to produce data required by DFTTools
  * Run a DMFT script based on DFTTools with VaspConverter class used as a converter

The format of the input file is described in section :doc:`Input Config-file <config>`.
