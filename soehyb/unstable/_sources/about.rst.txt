About
*****

The TRIQS Sum-Of-Exponentials bold HYBridization expansion impurity solver was originally developed by Z. Huang, J. Kaye, and H. U.R. Strand.

We thank N. Wentzell for contributions, support and guidance in using the `TRIQS library <https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs>`_ and its related packages. For the TRIQS application structure we are depending on the `app4triqs <https://github.com/TRIQS/app4triqs>`_ framework.
