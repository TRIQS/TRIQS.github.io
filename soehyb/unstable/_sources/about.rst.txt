About
*****

The TRIQS Sum-Of-Exponentials bold HYBridization expansion impurity solver was originally developed by Z. Huang, J. Kaye, and H. U.R. Strand. We thank N. Wentzell for contributions, support and guidance in using the `TRIQS library <https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs>`_ and its related packages.

For compact representation of imaginary time propagators we use the C++ implementation of the Discrete Lehmann Representation provided by the ` ``cppdlr`` library <github.com/flatironinstitute/cppdlr/>`_. The TRIQS application structure is inherited from the `app4triqs <https://github.com/TRIQS/app4triqs>`_ framework.
