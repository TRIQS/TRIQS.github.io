.. sidebar:: nrgljubljana_interface 2.2.0

   This is the homepage of nrgljubljana_interface v2.2.0. nrgljubljana_iterface provides C++ and Python interfaces between
   TRIQS and the NRG Ljubljana solver.

    "NRG Ljubljana" is a general-purpose flexible framework for performing large scale numerical renormalization group (NRG)
    calculations for quantum impurity problems. It is highly extensible without sacrificing numerical efficiency.
    It supports a great variety of impurity Hamiltonians and symmetry types. More details can be found on the
    `project homepage <http://nrgljubljana.ijs.si>`_, while the code itself is hosted on
    `Github <https://github.com/TRIQS/nrgljubljana_interface/>`_. 

   For changes see the :ref:`changelog page <changelog>`.
