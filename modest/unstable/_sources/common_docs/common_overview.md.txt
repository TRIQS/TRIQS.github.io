**ModEST** is a TRIQS application written in C++ with a Python interface, designed as a toolkit that extends the modular nature of TRIQS
with an API specifically tailored for electronic structure developers and users. Some of the key features include:

* Interfaces to external electronic codes (VASP, Quantum ESPRESO, Wien2k, Elk, AbInit, Wannier90).
* Generic represenation of DFT data (one-body elements).
* Powerful embedding description to articulate generic DMFT embedding scenarios.
* High-performant implementations of key functions: local Green's function, chemical potential search, lattice density, etc.
