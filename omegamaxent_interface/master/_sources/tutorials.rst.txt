Tutorials
=========

There are three `tutorials <OmegaMaxEnt_TRIQS_tutorials_>`_, with solved exercises, on OmegaMaxEnt_TRIQS:

An introductory_ one using a fictitious Green's functions for which the spectrum is known, which introduces to the features of :math:`\Omega MaxEnt`, the diagnostic tools in particular, with an exercise on the continuation of a matrix-valued Green's function.

Then, there are two tutorials on the analytic continuation of dynamical mean field (DMFT) results:

A comparison_ between the result of analytic continuation of a Matsubara frequency self-energy computed using a continuous-time hybridization expansion (CTHYB_) impurity solver and the real-frequency self-energy obtained directly with a numerical renormalization group (NRG) impurity solver.

The `analytic continuation of a self-energy`_ computed with `DMFT and density functional theory`_ for the material :math:`Sr_2CuO_4`.
