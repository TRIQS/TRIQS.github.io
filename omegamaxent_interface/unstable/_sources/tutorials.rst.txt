Tutorials
=========

We provide three `tutorials <omegamaxent_interface_tutorials_>`_, with solved exercises:

An introductory_ one using a fictitious Green's functions for which the spectrum is known.
The aim of this first tutorial is to introduce the main features of :math:`\Omega MaxEnt`,
in particular its diagnostic tools. The exercise is on the continuation of a matrix-valued Green's function.

Then, there are two tutorials on the analytic continuation of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) results:

First, a comparison_ between the result of analytic continuation of a Matsubara frequency self-energy computed using a continuous-time hybridization expansion (CTHYB_) impurity solver and the real-frequency self-energy obtained directly with a numerical renormalization group (NRG) impurity solver.

And second, the `analytic continuation of a self-energy`_ on the example of the `DMFT and density functional theory`_ solution for the material :math:`Sr_2RuO_4`.
